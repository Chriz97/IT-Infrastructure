# Linux Troubleshooting Logs Script
# All commands were tested on Fedora 41: KDE Spin.

# Shows all collected journal entries
# This displays a complete log of all system events managed by `systemd-journald`.
journalctl

# Shows logs related to a specific file
# Replace FILEPATH with the full path to the file you want to inspect logs for.
# Example: journalctl /usr/bin/ssh
journalctl FILEPATH

# Shows logs for the current boot
# The `-b` option filters logs to show entries only from the current boot session.
journalctl -b

# Shows kernel logs for the current boot
# The `-k` option filters logs to show only kernel messages, and `-b -1` shows logs from the previous boot.
journalctl -k -b -1

# Shows logs for a specific service
# Use this to debug issues with specific systemd services. Replace SERVICE_NAME with the service's name.
# Example: journalctl -u sshd
journalctl -u SERVICE_NAME

# Shows logs for a specific priority level (e.g., error messages)
# Priority levels range from 0 (emergency) to 7 (debug). Use `-p` to specify the priority.
# Example: Show error logs (priority 3 or lower)
journalctl -p err

# Follow logs in real-time
# The `-f` option continuously updates the log output as new entries are added, similar to `tail -f`.
journalctl -f

# Shows logs for a specific time range
# Use the `--since` and `--until` options to filter logs by date and time.
# Example: Show logs from the last hour
journalctl --since "1 hour ago"
# Example: Show logs from a specific date and time
journalctl --since "2024-11-12 10:00:00" --until "2024-11-12 12:00:00"

# Shows logs from a specific user
# Use the `_UID` filter to view logs related to a particular user.
# Example: Show logs for user with UID 1000
journalctl _UID=1000

# Clears the systemd journal logs (requires root privileges)
# WARNING: This will delete all stored journal entries.
sudo journalctl --rotate
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1s  # Clears all logs older than 1 second

# Analyze boot performance
# Shows a breakdown of the boot process and identifies slow services or processes.
systemd-analyze blame

# Generate a boot performance graph
# Produces a detailed SVG file showing the boot process timeline. Replace FILENAME with the output file name.
systemd-analyze plot > FILENAME.svg

# Inspect kernel ring buffer logs
# The `dmesg` command displays kernel messages, useful for troubleshooting hardware and kernel-related issues.
dmesg

# Filter dmesg logs by keyword
# Use `grep` to search for specific terms in kernel messages. Replace "UFW" with your search term.
# Example: Find messages related to UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
dmesg | grep -i "UFW"

# Show the most recent kernel messages
# Use `tail` to display the latest lines from `dmesg` output.
dmesg | tail

# Monitor kernel messages in real-time
# The `-w` option shows new kernel messages as they are logged.
dmesg -w

# Display dmesg logs with timestamps
# The `--time-format=iso` option displays timestamps in ISO format for better log correlation.
dmesg --time-format=iso
