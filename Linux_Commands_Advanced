sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' *.txt

# 6. Awk Command for Data Processing
# Example: Print the second column of a space-separated file.
awk '{print $2}' data.txt

# 7. Disk Usage Analysis
# Use du and df for disk usage details.
# Example: Show the disk usage of directories in the /var folder.
du -h /var | sort -h | tail -10

# Show disk space usage of all mounted filesystems
df -h

# 8. Process Management
# View and manage processes with ps, top, and kill.
# Example: Show all processes for a specific user.
ps -u username

# Example: Kill a process by name.

# Example: Add an ACL to allow a specific user read access to a file.
setfacl -m u:username:r /path/to/file

# 14. System Performance Monitoring
# Use top, htop, and iostat for performance metrics.
# Example: Monitor CPU and memory usage.
top

# Example: View detailed I/O statistics.
iostat -x 5

# 15. File Compression with xz
# Example: Compress a file with xz.
