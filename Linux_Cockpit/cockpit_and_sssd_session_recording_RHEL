# SSSD Session Recording Setup Script for RHEL
# Tested on RHEL-based systems with tlog and Cockpit Session Recording.
# This script installs necessary tools, configures SSSD for session recording, 
# and enables management via the Cockpit Web Console.

# Enable the CRB (CodeReady Builder) Repository
# The CRB repository is required for some dependencies. (Not required on Fedora, tested on 11/25/24 at 10:40 PM.
sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb

sudo dnf install cockpit => Only on Fedora, Centos and RHEL ship with cockpit installed

# Install Cockpit Session Recording and tlog
# Cockpit Session Recording integrates with the Cockpit Web Console to manage session recording.
# tlog is the logging tool for terminal sessions.
sudo dnf install cockpit-session-recording tlog -y

# Enable and Start the Cockpit Service
# The Cockpit Web Console is used to configure and manage session recording.
sudo systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket


# After enabling the cockpit.socket service, session recording configuration can be managed via the Cockpit Web Console.
# Access the Web Console by opening a web browser and navigating to:
# https://<server-ip>:9090
# Log in with your system credentials and navigate to the "Session Recording" section for further configurations.

# Restart SSSD Service
# Restarting SSSD ensures that any previous configurations are reset.
sudo systemctl restart sssd

# Configure SSSD for Session Recording
# Edit the SSSD configuration to enable session recording.
sudo nano /etc/sssd/conf.d/sssd-session-recording.conf

# Check the following configuration in the file:
# -----------------------------------------------------
# [sssd]
# services = nss, pam
# config_file_version = 2
# domains = default
#
# [domain/default]
# enumerate = true
#
# [session_recording]
# scope = all
# -----------------------------------------------------

# Save the configuration and restart SSSD for the changes to take effect.
sudo systemctl restart sssd
