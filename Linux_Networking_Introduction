# Linux Networking Introduction Script
# All commands were tested on Fedora 41: KDE Spin.

# Ping uses the ICMP protocol to check connectivity to a host.
# Example: ping google.com
ping google.com

ping -i 2 google.com # Specify an interval (A ping every two seconds)

# ifconfig (interface configuration) displays network interface configuration information.
# Example: ifconfig (shows IP addresses, MAC addresses, and more)
ifconfig

# nmcli is a command-line tool for managing network connections with NetworkManager.
# Example: nmcli device status (displays the status of all network devices)
nmcli device status

# To connect to a Wi-Fi network using nmcli, use the following:
# Example: nmcli device wifi connect "NetworkName" password "Password123"
nmcli device wifi connect "NetworkName" password "Password123"

# nslookup queries DNS to find the IP address associated with a domain name.
# Example: nslookup example.com (resolves example.com to an IP address)
nslookup example.com

# traceroute shows the path that packets take to reach a destination host.
# It displays each hop along the route and the response times for each hop.
# Example: traceroute google.com
traceroute google.com

# ip is a newer command replacing ifconfig for displaying and configuring network interfaces.
# Example: ip a (displays all network interfaces and IP addresses)
ip a

# ip route shows the routing table, detailing the paths packets take through the network.
# Example: ip route (shows default gateway and routes)
ip route

# dig (Domain Information Groper) queries DNS servers for information on domain names.
# Example: dig example.com (retrieves DNS records for example.com)
dig example.com

# arp (Address Resolution Protocol) shows or manipulates the system's ARP cache.
# This is useful for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses.
# Example: arp -a (displays the ARP table)
arp -a

# netstat displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
# It provides information on active network connections and listening ports.
# Example: netstat -tuln (shows listening TCP and UDP ports)
netstat -tuln

# ss (socket statistics) is similar to netstat but provides more detailed and faster output.
# Example: ss -tuln (shows listening TCP and UDP ports)
ss -tuln

# host resolves domain names to IP addresses (similar to nslookup).
# Example: host example.com
host example.com
