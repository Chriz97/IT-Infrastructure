# dnf-automatic Installation and Configuration Script for RHEL-Based Systems (e.g., Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)
# Note: This script sets up dnf-automatic to manage updates on RHEL-based systems by automating
# the download, installation, and notification of available software updates.


# Step 1: Install dnf-automatic
# dnf-automatic is an optional package that automates the download, installation, and/or notification of updates.

# - dnf-automatic-notifyonly.timer: Sends notifications about available updates without downloading them.

#
# To start a specific timer, use the appropriate timer name in place of <timer_name> in the command below.
